# Simple Linear Regression in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a simple linear regression example using Python. Linear regression is a basic statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Contents

- **linear_regression.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To run the code, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries listed above. Open the Jupyter notebook `linear_regression.ipynb` and execute each cell sequentially.

## Predicting Weight from Height

The notebook focuses on using linear regression to predict weight based on height. It covers the following key aspects:

### Dataset Preparation

- **Loading Data**: The dataset consisting of height and weight data is loaded into numpy arrays.
- **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained on the training data using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculated by scikit-learn's `mean_squared_error` function.

### Visualization

- **Data Visualization**: The data points from the training set are plotted using matplotlib's `scatter` function.
- **Fitted Line Plot**: The fitted line generated by the trained model is plotted on the same graph.

### Prediction

- **Weight Prediction**: An example of predicting weight from height is demonstrated using the trained model.

## Conclusion

This example provides a basic understanding of using linear regression to predict weight based on height and how it can be implemented in Python using common libraries. It serves as a starting point for learning more advanced regression techniques and machine learning concepts.
